# Bionic Reader

This is a very small project I created after watching a video about "bionic reading". This is where someones reading speed can significantly increase if the first half of each word in a text were in bold. 

I was curious about writing code that would do this for me, so I quickly created this small and simple project. 

If I were to spend more time on this, I would implement a nicer frontend using ReactJS.
